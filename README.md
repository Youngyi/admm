You need to implement the optimization method in the paper.
include the convolution, pooling, and ReLU layers.
compare the method you implement with the standard backpropagation method on some benchmark image datasets.
write a report to describe the details of your implementation and the comparison results. 
The report and source codes should be put in github.
